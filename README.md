# Welcome to Ollama's Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial

## Course introduction and goals

This course was inspired by [Anthropic's Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial](https://github.com/anthropics/prompt-eng-interactive-tutorial) and is intended to provide you with a comprehensive step-by-step understanding of how to engineer optimal prompts within Ollama using the 'qwen2.5:14b' model.

**After completing this course, you will be able to**:

- Master the basic structure of a good prompt 
- Recognize common failure modes and learn how to address them
- Build strong prompts from scratch for common use cases

## Course structure and content

This course is structured to allow you many chances to practice writing and troubleshooting prompts yourself. The course is broken up into **9 chapters with accompanying exercises**, as well as an appendix of even more advanced methods. It is intended for you to **work through the course in chapter order**.

**Each lesson has an "Example Playground" area** at the bottom where you are free to experiment with the examples in the lesson and see for yourself how changing prompts can change Ollama's responses.

Note: This tutorial uses [Qwen 2.5 14B model](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5:14b). If this is too large for your hardware, you can try the [Qwen 2.5 7B model](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5:7b) which is smaller and faster.


When you are ready to begin, go to `01_Basic Prompt Structure` to proceed.
